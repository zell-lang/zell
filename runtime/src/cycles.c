/* cycles.c - the bounded cycle collector (DESIGN.md "Циклы", ABI.md 3.8).
 *
 * Synchronous trial deletion in the style of Bacon and Rajan, restricted to
 * objects of potentially cyclic types (ZELL_RC_CYCLIC, set at allocation
 * by zell_cycles_new, and by slice.c/map.c for containers whose element
 * ops have a visitor). It is not a tracing collector: it never scans the
 * heap or any roots, only the objects reachable through cyclic-typed
 * references from the *possible roots* recorded since the last run, and
 * ordinary objects (strings, plain-data slices, everything not flagged)
 * never take part.
 *
 * Possible roots: a flagged object whose count is decremented to a value
 * other than zero may have become the entry of an unreachable cycle; it is
 * recorded once (ZELL_RC_BUFFERED) in its thread's candidate buffer. When
 * a buffered object's count reaches zero it is dropped at once (Drop timing
 * is unchanged) and becomes a ZOMBIE: its memory stays until the buffer's
 * owner sweeps it. Full local buffers are swept and published to a global
 * list; in auto mode a collection is due once the threads together have
 * recorded `threshold` roots since the last one was requested: the thread
 * that trips the count publishes its buffer and requests the collection,
 * the others publish theirs at their next record, and it runs at the next
 * allocation of a cyclic object by compiled code (a safe point: the same
 * place a callee could already run any Drop), on that thread. Other
 * threads keep running.
 *
 * A collection (collect):
 *  0. g_collecting = 1 (seq_cst). From now on no flagged object's memory is
 *     freed (it is deferred to the end), so every object the collector got
 *     a pointer to from a live object stays readable.
 *  1. Take the published roots and this thread's buffer, clear BUFFERED.
 *  2. Discovery: from the live roots, follow the references the type
 *     visitors report to flagged objects; each new object is MARKED with
 *     an atomic OR whose result is its count snapshot.
 *  3. After every object is marked, visit them all again and subtract each
 *     internal reference from the target's snapshot (trial deletion).
 *  4. Scan: anything with a remaining count is referenced from outside the
 *     set; it and everything reachable from it are live (black).
 *  5. Validate: any white object whose header shows DIRTY (a retain or
 *     release happened after it was marked) or whose count differs from
 *     the snapshot becomes black, with what it reaches; repeated under the
 *     weak-table lock, which then also clears the weak boxes of the whites.
 *  6. Collect white: take one reference to each, run their destructors
 *     (Drop) first, recount the references among them (a Drop that stored
 *     a member somewhere keeps that member and what it reaches alive, and
 *     leaked, so no Drop ever runs twice), then release their fields and
 *     free them.
 *  7. Unmark; a member that was DIRTY becomes a possible root again.
 *     g_collecting = 0 and the deferred frees happen.
 *
 * The invariant (why concurrent mutators are safe): while MARKED, every
 * change of an object's count is visible as DIRTY, because every retain
 * and release of a flagged object is an atomic RMW whose result is
 * checked for MARKED (mem.c, weak.c and here; single-threaded processes
 * need none: the collector then runs alone). A mutator can only create or
 * remove a reference to an object by changing its count. So if a white
 * object's count is still its snapshot at validation time, every
 * reference that count stands for was read in step 3 and still exists,
 * and all of them come from white objects (black ones would have
 * blackened it). Hence no thread holds a reference to the white set and
 * none can get one: it is garbage, and stays garbage, except through weak
 * references, which step 5 clears under the lock zell_weak_get takes.
 * Reading fields concurrently is safe because frees of flagged objects
 * are deferred (step 0, with seq_cst fences on both sides) and the
 * collector only dereferences objects that are statically flagged or
 * whose dynamic type id is registered. Maps are walked only while the
 * process is single-threaded (map.c). */
