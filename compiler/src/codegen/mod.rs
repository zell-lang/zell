//!
//! # Value representation (compiler-side ABI, v0.1)
//!
//! | Zell type | LLVM | Notes |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `int`, `uint`, `intN`, `uintN`, `byte` | `i64`, `iN` | signedness only in instructions |
//! | `float` / `float32` | `double` / `float` | |
//! | `bool` | `i1` | `zeroext` at every C call boundary; 1 byte in memory |
//! | `char` | `i32` | code point |
//! | `string` | `ptr` | runtime `zell_string*` (`{hdr, len, data ptr}`, ABI.md §4.1: owned or a view), NULL is `""`; literals are immortal constant globals whose `data` points at their own bytes |
//! | `*T` | `ptr` | address of the `T` itself: the **payload** of a heap object (object + 16), owning one reference; see "Pointers" |
//! | `weak *T` | `ptr` | runtime weak box (ABI.md §3.4), NULL = nil |
//! | struct | named LLVM struct by value | fields in HIR order |
//! | `[N]T` | `[N x T]` | by value |
//! | `[]T` | `{ptr data, i64 len, i64 cap, ptr backing}` | ABI.md §5, the slice value owns one reference to `backing` |
//! | `map[K]V` | `ptr` | runtime `zell_map*`; `string`/`int` keys use the fast paths |
//! | `error` | `ptr` | runtime `zell_error*`, NULL = no error |
//! | `T!` | `{T, ptr err}` | `void!` is just the `ptr err` |
//! | tuple | anonymous LLVM struct | |
//! | plain enum | `i32` tag | variant index |
//! | data enum | `{i32 tag, [W x i64] payload}` | payload is the variant's fields as an anonymous struct, 8-aligned |
//! | interface | `{ptr data, ptr vtable}` | vtable `{ptr typeid, i64 boxed, ptr method0, ...}` (methods in interface order) |
//! | `any` | `{ptr data, ptr typeinfo}` | boxed, except bool/integers/floats/char, whose value bits are the data word (ABI.md §3.7) |
//! | `func(..)` | `{ptr fn, ptr env}` | `fn(env, args...)`; `env` is NULL or an env object |
//! | `Task<T>` | `ptr` | runtime `zell_task*` |
//!
//! **Heap objects.** Every heap allocation made by compiled code is an ABI.md
//! §3 object (`zell_object_new`): `new T`, boxes (struct values stored in
//! interfaces / `any` / errors), *cells* and closure environments. One
//! `zell_type_info` per boxed type `T` (`ti.<T>`) has a `drop` that releases
//! the references inside the `T` payload at offset 16. Its address is also
//! the run-time type id used by type switches and `errors.As`; the type id of
//! a stored `*S` is `ti.<*S>`.
//!
//! **Reflection** ([`reflect`], ABI.md §17). When the program uses
//! `reflect` (`Program::reflect`), every type id is instead the payload
//! of an immortal `reflect.TypeInfo` object whose first three words are
//! the `zell_type_info` (`name`, `size`, `drop`), so the same pointer is
//! the box type, `vtable[0]`, the `any` type word and a Zell
//! `*reflect.TypeInfo`. Tables reference fields, methods (packed `invoke`
//! thunks and closure thunks), variants and attribute values (constant
//! structs) as immortal objects through NULL-backed slices. Functions
//! listed in `Reflect::intrinsics` get their bodies from
//! `CodeGen::emit_intrinsic` instead of their HIR.
//!
//! **Interfaces.** Storing a struct value boxes a copy (`boxed = 1`);
//! storing a `*S` stores the pointer (`boxed = 0`). Either way a non-nil
//! interface value owns one reference to the object whose payload `data`
//! is (released with `zell_ptr_release(data)`). Method `m` is `vtable[2 + m](data, args...)`;
//! methods promoted from embedded structs get an adjusting thunk. An
//! interface default method is one function `F(iface this, args...)`; the
//! slot of a type that does not declare the method holds a thunk
//! `(data, args) -> F({data, vtable of the type for the declaring
//! interface}, args)`. Enum values are boxed like struct values; their slots
//! are thunks loading the enum from `data` (enum methods take the value).
//! `case I x:` on an `any` looks the vtable up with `iface.conv.N(typeid)`
//! (NULL = no match) and unwraps a stored `*S` when `boxed = 0`. Storing a
//! struct in an `error` boxes it and calls `zell_error_new_typed` with a
//! `Message()` thunk; when the struct has `Unwrap() error`, its result
//! (+1) is stored into the new error's `inner` (+24). `error` method 0 is
//! `zell_error_message`.
//!
//! **Arenas.** `Builtin::ArenaNew` (`*T`) and `ArenaSlice` (`[]T`) call
//! `zell_arena_object` / `zell_arena_slice` (runtime/ABI.md 3.6): the
//! objects carry refcount `ZELL_RC_ARENA`, so the ordinary retain/release
//! calls on them are no-ops and no special casing is emitted.
//!
//! **Leak check names.** With `--leak-check` type names (mode 2), C `main`
//! calls `leak.fields`, which registers the `*T` field offsets of every
//! struct type info as `"Type.Field"` (`zell_leak_fields`, ABI.md 3.5).
//!
//! **Closures.** A closure is `{fn, env}`. `env` is NULL for closures without
//! captures, else an object `{hdr, i64 n, ptr cell[n]}` whose drop releases
//! the cells. Captured locals (`Local::captured`) live in *cells*: objects
//! `{hdr, T value}`; the function's slot holds the cell pointer, every
//! execution of the `Let` creates a fresh cell, and closures retain the
//! cells, so variables are shared by reference. Named functions used as
//! values get a thunk `fn(env, args) -> f(args)`. Lifted lambdas take the
//! env pointer as an extra first parameter.
//!
//! **Address-taken locals** (`Local::address_taken`) also live in cells,
//! so `&x` is a whole-object pointer, unless escape analysis
//! ([`crate::hir::ownership::stack_locals`]) proves the address does not
//! escape: then the local (`StackKind::Cell`), or the object of a
//! non-escaping `var p = new T{...}` (`StackKind::New`), is an entry alloca
//! `{i64 -1, ptr null, T}` with an immortal header, and `&x` / `p` point at
//! its payload. Leaving the scope of such a `p` releases the fields.
//!
//! **Constants need no reference counting.** A constant pointer operand
//! (NULL, or the address of an immortal global: a string literal, a
//! reflection table, an attribute value [`ExprKind::AttrConst`]) is never
//! retained or released (`rc_val`), and a local of a pointer type that
//! only ever held such constants (`FnState::const_only`, cleared by the
//! first other store; a store at the loop depth of its `Let` also skips
//! releasing the old constant) is not released at the end of its block or
//! at the function exit, the two points where every store to it has
//! already been emitted. `len(s)` of a string is the inline load of the
//! length word (NULL is 0). The error-trace calls of `?` run only when the
//! error is not NULL (`trace::when_error`).
//!
//! **Reference counting fast paths.** With `Options::inline_rc` (the
//! default; `ZELL_NO_INLINE_RC=1` at build time turns it off)
//! `call_rt` routes `zell_retain`/`zell_release`/`zell_ptr_*` to internal
//! `alwaysinline` helpers (`rc.rs`, `rc_inline_fn`) that update the count
//! inline while the process is single-threaded, or the owner's 16-bit half
//! of a biased count owned by this thread (the runtime's thread-local
//! `zell_rc_owner`, declared `external thread_local`), and call the
//! runtime otherwise (ABI.md 3.1, 3.2).
//!
//! **Fallible results** travel as first-class aggregates between Zell
//! functions. Stdlib externs follow `zell_rt.h`: `[]T` params as
//! `const zell_slice*`, a `[]T` result through a trailing out-pointer,
//! `T!` as `T` plus a trailing `zell_error **err` (`void!`: only the
//! out-error). Errors record a return trace (ABI.md §7.4, [`trace`]):
//! creation sites and every `?` / catching `try` pass a static
//! `zell_error_site` to the runtime. A shared error (a sentinel) keeps its
//! trace in a thread-local pending record while it propagates; the end of
//! the propagation settles it: `try ... catch err` calls `zell_error_caught`
//! with `keep` = "the handler can observe the trace" (any use of `err`
//! other than `Message()` / `errors.Is`), `try ... else` and a catch without
//! a binding call `zell_error_discarded`, and an async result is settled
//! before `zell_task_complete`. A `?` inside a block `try` branches
//! to its `catch` ([`TryTarget`]) instead of returning.
//!
//! **Functions.** Every function has a single exit block: `return` stores
//! the result into a slot and branches there; the exit block runs deferred
//! closures (LIFO, up to 64 per call, kept in an alloca'd array), releases
//! the locals and returns. `async` functions are LLVM switched-resume
//! coroutines following ABI.md §10.3 (see [`async_`]): `void @f(params,
//! ptr %res)` with `%res -> { ptr task; T value }`; the coroutine makes
//! its `Task<T>` (`zell_task_lazy`) only at its first suspension and
//! stores it into `res.task`, while a body that returns without suspending
//! leaves NULL there and moves its result into `res.value` (the
//! synchronous fast path: no task, and no frame when the body has no
//! suspend point, through `llvm.coro.alloc`). Frames come from
//! `zell_coro_frame_alloc` and go back with `zell_coro_frame_free`. Callers
//! awaiting a direct call read `res.value` when `res.task` is NULL; callers
//! keeping the task, and thunks of async functions used as values,
//! materialise a done task with `zell_task_completed`. The build pipeline
//! (`crate::build`) runs `default<On>`, which in LLVM 18 includes the
//! coroutine passes (coro-early, coro-split, coro-elide, coro-cleanup; at
//! O0 via the CoroConditionalWrapper), so coroutines are lowered at every
//! optimisation level.
//!
//! # Reference counting
//!
//! Managed: `string`, `[]T`, `map`, `error`, `Task`, `*T`, `weak *T`,
//! closures (their env), interface/`any` values, and aggregates (structs,
//! tuples, arrays, `T!`, data enums) containing those or a struct with a
//! destructor, via generated per-type retain/release helpers (also used as
//! `zell_value_ops` for containers). `*T` uses `zell_ptr_retain/release`
//! (header = payload - 16) and `zell_ops_ptr`.
//!
//! * Expression results are *owned* (+1: calls, constructors, `new`,
//!   concatenation) or *borrowed* (loads from places, literals). Storing a
//!   borrowed value into a location retains it; owned temporaries are
//!   released after their use.
//! * Stores release the previous value (after retaining the new one).
//! * **Parameters** (see `hir::ownership`): *borrowed* by default (no
//!   retain on entry, no release at exit, the slot is marked in
//!   `FnState::borrowed`); *owned* (retained on entry) when the function is
//!   `async` or reassigns the parameter; *moved* (owned, not retained) for
//!   types with a destructor. Callers (`CodeGen::arg` in `expr.rs`) pass owned
//!   temporaries and stable values (non-cell locals, constants) as they
//!   are and retain ("pin") any other borrowed value for the call; unknown
//!   callees (closures, interface methods) are treated as borrowing.
//! * **Locals** are released at function exit (last declared first, after
//!   the deferred calls); `Let` locals of nested blocks are also released
//!   (and zeroed) at the end of their block and by `break`/`continue` out
//!   of it, see [`cleanup`]. Re-executing a `Let` releases the old value.
//!   Stack values with a destructor have a drop flag (`FnState::flags`).
//!   *Borrowed locals* ([`crate::hir::borrow`], DESIGN.md "Память") of
//!   heap-pure functions (`CodeGen::pure_fns`) are stored without a retain
//!   and never released (`FnState::borrow_local`, also marked in
//!   `FnState::borrowed`). *Borrow-returning functions*
//!   (`hir::borrow::borrow_returning`, `CodeGen::borrow_ret`) are emitted
//!   twice: the body under their symbol returns its parameter paths
//!   without a retain (`FnState::borrow_ret`, `borrowed_return`) and is
//!   called directly when the arguments are stable for the statement
//!   (`borrow_call`; the result is then a borrowed `Val`), and a `.rc`
//!   wrapper (`funcs[fid]`, `emit_rc_wrapper`) retains the result for every
//!   other use.
//! * **Temporaries** held while later operands are evaluated live on the
//!   cleanup stack ([`cleanup`]) and are released on early exits (`?`,
//!   `try ... else return/break/continue`, `return`, `break`, `continue`
//!   inside `catch` blocks).
//! * Results are returned +1; runtime borrowed results are retained.
//! * `s += x`, `s = s + x` (`zell_string_append`) and `xs = append(xs,
//!   x)` on a local move the old value into the runtime call, which grows
//!   uniquely referenced strings/backings in place.
//! * **Destructors**: the release helper of a struct with `func Drop()`
//!   calls it first, then releases the fields.
//!
//! # Pointers
//!
//! A stored `*T` always points at a whole object (`new`, a variable's cell,
//! a box). Interior pointers (`&s.f`, `&a[i]`, `&slice[i]`, `&global`) are
//! borrowed-only: sema (`sema::ownership`) only lets them be read through
//! or passed to non-escaping parameters, and `CodeGen::place_ex`
//! pins their owners (the dereferenced pointer, the slice) for the call.
//! An interior pointer stored in a local (`var p = &xs[i]`) is never
//! retained itself: the local's hidden pin slots hold its owners
//! (`interior.rs`). Sub-slices of a local array own the array's cell.
//!
//! Not released (by design): values reachable from a panicking task (a
//! panic does not unwind), strong reference cycles (use `weak`; detected by
//! `--leak-check`; freed by the cycle collector, below), values in the
//! 64-slot defer array beyond a panic.
//!
//! **Cycle collector** ([`cycles`], ABI.md 3.8). Types on a cycle of the
//! type reference graph ([`crate::sema::cycles`]) are allocated with
//! `zell_cycles_new_entry(entry, size)` (it sets the flag), where `entry` is a
//! per-type registry entry (type info, payload visitor, destructor-only and
//! release-only helpers, the `ti.<*S>` alias) that the runtime registers
//! on first use; closure environments capturing such cells get a
//! per-lambda type info and entry (alias: the lambda's function); every
//! compiled `zell_value_ops` has a third `visit` word (non-NULL for
//! element types holding references to cyclic objects). Pins of a `*T` of
//! a cyclic type (`expr.rs` `arg`/`keep`) read `zell_cycles_epoch` and are
//! released with `zell_ptr_release_noroot` (`FnState::pins`).
//!
//! **Leak check.** With [`Options::leak_check`] the C `main` calls
//! `zell_leak_check_enable` first; after the entry point returns, the
//! globals are released (reverse initialisation order) before
//! `zell_runtime_shutdown`, which reports live objects.
